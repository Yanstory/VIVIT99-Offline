ＶＩＶＩＴ－９９, count as a new game by 瞬殺サレ道？, the Seihou Project producer, is a STG royale game inspired from [Tetris 99](https://tetris99.nintendo.com/).
You will start a game with other 98 players, and try to beat them by graze utill you are the only survivor.

Due to something, this game has only PVE (Vs. CPU), and has no PVP mode. All other players are CPU.

However it's still fun. It's opened at 0:00 JST, April 1 2019 at the offical page, and only avaliable in April 1.

Now the page turns to a relic, and we can't exprience any more except archive.org.
